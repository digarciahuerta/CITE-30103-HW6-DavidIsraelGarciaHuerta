the first error is having the 1 as the first character in the variable name that is not allowed, so you could just leave it as int value or push it to the end as int value1 =10; for the 2nd you are not allowed to have specific special characters you could remove it entirely or replace that dash with and underscore like so: float avg_rate=12.5;. the third error you cannot use class as that is a keyword in programming so you have to go with an entirely different name.
